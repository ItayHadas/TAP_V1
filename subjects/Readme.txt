To run TAP with the Ernie headmodel please copy or create (recommended!) the Ernie headmodel (with standard parameter as described online at https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/index.html) in folder Ernie_headreco or Ernie_mri2mesh. Note, if you really want to copy the "ernie" head model folder, then  please make sure the subject folder matches the head mesh file (i.e., ernie.msh ) and subfolder names (e.g., m2m_ernie, d2c_ernie, etc.).
