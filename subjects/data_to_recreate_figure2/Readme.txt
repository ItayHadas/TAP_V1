1) 
All imaging data and derivatives generated by SimNIBS 2.0.1 upon request. 
Note, we converted the subject meshes and DTI information and saved them as '*_bin.msh' files (contain all anisotropic conductivities generated with itensor and tissue label-based mapping of default isotropic conductivities) for gmsh4 SimNIBS (>= 3.2.x) so we can run ADM.

2)  
If you have all files from the authors from step 1), then E-field simulations can be run after patching your SimNIBS (>= 3.2.x) installation, e.g., file 'cond.py' (in MacOS this file is stored at ~/SimNIBS-3.2//simnibs_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/simnibs/simulation/)  at the end of the python function 'cond2elmdata' please add these 3 lines to load the conductivity information from the '*_bin.msh' file:
    cond.value = np.zeros(shape=(len(cond.value),9),dtype=np.float64)
    for i in range (0, len(mesh.elmdata[0].value)-1):
        cond.value[i] = mesh.elmdata[0].value[i]

    cond.assign_triangle_values()

    return cond
3)
Run 'retro_gateway.m' in MATLAB to generate all subfigures of the Figure 2 in the publication
